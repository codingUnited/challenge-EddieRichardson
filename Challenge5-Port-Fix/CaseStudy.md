# üìö Case Study: From *Buggy.cpp* to a Clean Python Library System

## üéØ Background
The original **`Buggy.cpp`** was a deliberately flawed C++ program designed as a teaching tool.  
Its purpose was to simulate an *online reader system* where users could sign up, log in, add books, and read them page by page.  

At first glance, it looked functional ‚Äî but it was riddled with design flaws, unsafe memory handling, and incomplete features.

---

## üêû Problems in the Original `Buggy.cpp`
- **Memory management**: Raw `new`/`delete` everywhere ‚Üí leaks and dangling pointers.
- **Unsafe pointers**: `BookReadingSession` stored a raw `Book*`. If the book was deleted, the session pointed to garbage.
- **Broken signup**: `UsersManager::DoSignUp` called `current_user->Read(...)` without creating a new `User` object ‚Üí undefined behavior.
- **Lost data**: `UsersManager::LoadDatabase` reloaded dummy users every login, wiping out signups.
- **Incomplete methods**: `BooksManager::GetBook` always returned `nullptr`.
- **Input handling**: `cin >>` everywhere ‚Üí no spaces in names/titles, no validation.
- **Tight coupling**: Logic, I/O, and data management tangled together.
- **No persistence**: All data lost when the program exited.
- **No testing**: No way to verify correctness or catch regressions.

## ‚úÖ The Python Rewrite (`portfix`)
The Python port re‚Äëengineered the system with clarity and safety:

- **User system**: `User` and `UserDB` classes with safe signup/login, duplicate checks, and progress tracking.
- **Book system**: `Book` and `BookDB` classes with ISBN, title, author, and page content.
- **Engine**: `LibraryEngine` orchestrates users and books, cleanly separated from the CLI.
- **CLI**: Menu loop mirrors the original but with safer input handling.
- **Reading sessions**: Progress tracked per user/book, no dangling pointers.
- **Memory safety**: Python‚Äôs garbage collection eliminates manual `new`/`delete`.
- **Tests**: 100% coverage across all modules, verifying every branch and edge case.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design, easy to extend with persistence or richer input.

## üìã Checklist: Original Goals vs. Python Port

| Feature / Goal                     | Buggy.cpp (C++)              | Python Port |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Signup & login                     | Buggy, unsafe                | Safe, tested |
| User profile (name, email, admin)  | Present                      | Present |
| Add books                          | Admin only, fragile          | Admin only, tested |
| Preloaded books                    | Yes                          | Yes |
| Reading sessions                   | Implemented, unsafe pointers | Implemented, safe |
| Track current page & last access   | Yes                          | Yes |
| Reading history per user           | Yes                          | Yes |
| Menu‚Äëdriven CLI                    | Yes                          | Yes |
| Persistence across runs            | No                           | No (same as original) |
| Memory safety                      | Manual, buggy                | Automatic, safe |
| Test coverage                      | None                         | 100% |

## üèÜ The Transformation
The original `Buggy.cpp` was a **teaching tool**: it showed the shape of an online reader system but was riddled with pitfalls.  

The Python rewrite not only replicates the intended behavior but **fixes every major flaw** and adds professional‚Äëgrade testing and structure.  

This project demonstrates:
- **Reverse engineering** a legacy system.  
- **Documenting flaws** and mapping them to fixes.  
- **Delivering a maintainable, testable, and extensible solution**.
