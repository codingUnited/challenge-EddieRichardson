Coding Challenge: “Port & Fix” — Rescue an Old C++11 App
Overview
You’re given a small, buggy C++11 console application with little to no documentation. Your job is to:

Reverse-engineer what it does,
Fix the bugs, and
Rewrite the app in another language of your choice: Java / JavaScript / PHP / C# / Go / Python.
Keep the original functionality (feature parity), but produce a modern, maintainable implementation.

Learning Goals
Reading/understanding legacy code with minimal docs
Debugging and writing tests to pin down behavior
Designing a clean architecture in a new language
Shipping a small, production-ready CLI or web-miniapp
Starter Assets
Legacy repo (C++11) with:
Source files (buggy)
Note: Building/running the C++11 version may be annoying—by design. That’s part of the challenge.

Requirements
Functional
Maintain feature parity with the legacy behavior (as discovered by tests you write and by exploring the app).
For CLI apps: expose the same core commands/flags.
Correct the observable wrong behaviors (logic errors, edge cases).
Non-Functional
Clear README with: problem summary, how to run, assumptions, and decisions.
Automated tests covering core logic + at least 3 edge cases you discovered.
Error handling and helpful messages for bad inputs.
Basic logging at useful points (debug/info or equivalent).
