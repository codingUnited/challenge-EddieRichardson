## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-08
### Added
- Full end-to-end CLI integration test (`test_full_user_flow`) covering signup â†’ login â†’ add book â†’ read â†’ exit.
- `pytest.ini` with custom markers (`users`, `books`, `engine`, `helpers`, `cli`, `system`, `smoke`, `integration`) and default coverage options.

### Changed
