## ðŸ§­ Usage

Each file in this folder is meant to be **living documentation**:
- Update as you discover new bugs, assumptions, or design insights.  
- Keep entries concise but clear â€” think of it as a logbook for future maintainers.  
- Cross-link between docs where helpful (e.g., a bug entry linking to the test that covers it).  
- Ensure references stay up to date when files are renamed or reorganized.
