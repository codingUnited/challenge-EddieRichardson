# Coding Challenge: “Port & Fix” — Rescue an Old C++11 App

## 📌 Overview
You’re given a small, buggy C++11 console application with little to no documentation.  
Your job is to:

1. Reverse-engineer what it does  
2. Fix the bugs  
3. Rewrite the app in another language of your choice: **Java / JavaScript / PHP / C# / Go / Python**  

Keep the original functionality (feature parity), but produce a modern, maintainable implementation.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Reading/understanding legacy code with minimal docs  
- Debugging and writing tests to pin down behavior  
- Designing a clean architecture in a new language  
- Shipping a small, production-ready CLI or web miniapp  

---

## 📦 Starter Assets
Legacy repo (C++11) with:
- Source files (buggy)  
- A short “mystery spec” (1–2 paragraphs describing the app’s supposed purpose)  
- A handful of sample input files / sample CLI invocations  
- Known Issues List (intentionally incomplete)  

> **Note:** Building/running the C++11 version may be annoying—by design. That’s part of the challenge.

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Functional
- Maintain feature parity with the legacy behavior (as discovered by tests you write and by exploring the app).  
- For CLI apps: expose the same core commands/flags.  
- For web ports: preserve equivalent routes/inputs.  
- Correct the observable wrong behaviors (logic errors, edge cases).  

### Non-Functional
- Clear README with: problem summary, how to run, assumptions, and decisions.  
- Automated tests covering core logic + at least 3 edge cases you discovered.  
- Error handling and helpful messages for bad inputs.  
- Basic logging at useful points (debug/info or equivalent).
